# Tests for scripts/in-toolchain-image.sh's CPU bound: the stage's --cpus,
# GOMAXPROCS and GOFLAGS=-p all take the computed bound, capped at the
# daemon's NCPU when `docker info` reports a positive integer below it; empty,
# 0, malformed or failed output leaves the bound as it was. A stub `docker` on
# PATH records every call and answers `docker info` with STUB_NCPU (exit
# STUB_NCPU_RC); a stub `tar` keeps the copy-in off the image's own tar.
# IN_IMAGE_CPUS sets the bound, so the host's CPU count never matters.
#
#   usage: scripts/in-toolchain-image-test.sh   (also: make in-toolchain-image-test)
