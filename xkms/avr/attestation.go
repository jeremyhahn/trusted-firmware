// AttestKey asks the device to mint an alias certificate carrying the
// challenge, and checks what it answered.
//
// The challenge is 32 bytes and it is SHA-256 of the ACME key authorization.
// Compute it with deviceattest01.DICENonce, which exists so a device, a
// provisioning tool and a test cannot each hash something slightly different --
// a trailing newline, the token rather than the whole authorization -- and
// produce a mismatch whose cause is invisible from either end. THIS FUNCTION
// DOES NOT HASH: a caller that passed a raw key authorization would be refused
// for its width rather than quietly enrolled against something else.
//
// What is checked, in order, and every one of them refuses:
//
//  1. The challenge is the enrolment width. Refused here, before a frame is
//     built, because the device's other nonce is 16 bytes and a device handed
//     the shorter one cannot tell it was truncated.
//  2. The bytes parse as a certificate.
//  3. Its key is on P-256 and its signature is ECDSA-SHA256. The element holds
//     a key on no other curve and makes no other signature, so anything else
//     was not minted by that hardware.
//  4. Its tcg-dice-UCCS-evidence extension is readable.
//  5. The eat_nonce claim is the challenge this host issued. A DICE device has
//     no clock: this nonce is the only thing separating a live answer from a
//     replayed recording, and it is compared in constant time.
//  6. When roots are configured, the certificate descends from one.
//
// The nonce check is NOT conditional on anything. Anchoring is, because roots
// belong to whoever configured them and a bench device has none; Anchored says
// which happened.
