// It holds no private key and needs no locked memory: the identity's private
// half is inside the element and the wire defines no command that would let it
// out. What this type holds is the device's CAPS reply, read once on
// construction and never re-read.
//
// Caching CAPS is not an optimisation, it is what makes Capabilities
// answerable. types.KeyProvider.Capabilities returns no error, so a backend
// that had to ask the device what it was every time would have to invent an
// answer whenever the device did not reply — and the invented answer would be
// about the strength of a root of trust. Asking once, at construction, means a
// backend either exists and knows what it is talking to, or does not exist.

	// arrives, collecting events and discarding replies to other sequences on
	// the way. Two goroutines in Do at once therefore consume each other's
	// replies, and the loser sees a timeout rather than an answer. AttestCert
	// is worse: it is several Do calls that must stay CONTIGUOUS, because the

	// second attestation interleaved between two page reads splices two
	// certificates into one buffer.
