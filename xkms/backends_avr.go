// AVR device backend (from go-xkms pkg/backend/avr/, go-xkms#646; moved here by
// trusted-firmware#28)
//
// One attached AVR device -- an 8-bit part with an ATECC608A secure element --
// presented as an xkms key provider. It generates nothing and signs nothing a
// host hands it: what it does is mint an alias certificate carrying the
// verifier's challenge in the eat_nonce claim of its tcg-dice-UCCS-evidence
// extension, which is the DICE evidence path.
//
// THIS FILE IS WHY THE BACKEND IS REACHABLE AT ALL. It was written when the
// backend lived in go-xkms's pkg/, which go-trusted-platform's layer guard
// refuses to import; the aliases below were the only way across. The backend now
// lives in this module's avr package, so they are a convenience surface rather
// than a necessity, and they are kept so a consumer's code does not change.
//
// The device itself comes from github.com/jeremyhahn/trusted-firmware/sdk/go,
// which is a separate Layer 0 module a consumer imports directly -- there is
// nothing here to re-export it through. Open the link, wrap it in a tfw.Device,
// and hand that to NewAVRBackend.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// AVRBackend is one attached AVR device as a key provider. It is a
// types.KeyProvider and an attesting provider; it is deliberately not a signer,
// because the wire protocol defines no command that signs a digest the host
// supplied -- a device that did would be a signing oracle for anyone who
// reached the serial line.
type AVRBackend = avr.Backend

// AVRConfig configures the backend: the common name the device's one key is
// addressed by, the element slot holding it, the per-command timeout, and what
// an attestation must prove.
type AVRConfig = avr.Config

// AVRAttestationConfig is what an alias certificate must prove: the roots it
// must descend from and the intermediates between. Both are optional, and a nil
// AVRAttestationConfig is the unanchored profile -- the challenge, the curve
// and the signature algorithm are still checked, and AVRAttestation.Anchored
// reports false so a caller cannot mistake one for the other.
type AVRAttestationConfig = avr.AttestationConfig

// AVRAttestation is what the device answered and what the host made of it: the
// alias certificate, the device's own bytes of it, the decoded CWT claims set,
// the challenge that was matched, and whether anchoring ran.
type AVRAttestation = avr.Attestation

// AVRIdentity is the element's hardware identity -- serial number, die revision
// and the lock state of both zones. A fielded device refuses to report it,
// because the provisioning commands are compiled out of the image a part ships
// with; that refusal is the ordinary answer and not a fault.
type AVRIdentity = avr.Identity

// AVRHealth is the device's runtime state. Nothing in it is a timestamp: the
// part has no clock, so uptime and the reset cause are what distinguish a
// device that keeps restarting from one that is simply up.

// read from the element. It is not a crypto.Signer, for the reason AVRBackend
